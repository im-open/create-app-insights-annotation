# create-app-insights-annotation

An action to create an annotation in Azure App Insights flagging any event you like.

Prior to using this action, you need to be logged into Azure.  By default, this action creates a `Deployment` annotation but any other types of user defined categories can be created by setting the `category` input to your desired type.  If you use other types though, they may not show on many of the different views as expected.

This action runs the steps described in Microsoft's [Create release annotations with Azure CLI] document.  Additional information can be found on that page for [viewing the annotations] as well.

### Incrementing the Version

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |
